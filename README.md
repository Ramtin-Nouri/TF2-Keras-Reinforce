# TF2_Keras_Reinforce

Implementation of REINFORCE in (Tensorflow 2) Keras for Pong.  
This implementation was build for the Uni Hamburg Neural Network Seminar.


## Prerequisites
Tensorflow-2, OpenCV, Gym[atari], numpy

## Run
There are two implementations.  
One using a simple dense layer network and one with a CNN.  
  
### To run them use either the trainDense notebook or the trainCNN notebook.
